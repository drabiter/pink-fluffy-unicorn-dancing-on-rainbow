<hr>

- These are programming languages that I have played with before, mostly when attending college.
- All of them are direct port.
- Some languages give different colors output, that's why they have different rainbow colors code.
- Most of them don't follow the best pratice in each language's habitat.
- Original idea in Ruby by [@hungryzi](https://github.com/hungryzi/pink-fluffy-unicorn-on-rainbow), that's why no Ruby version here.
- Different terminal may give different result.
- This README is too long for a joke repo.
